## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new()
```


`google-beta.google_workstations_workstation_config.new` injects a new `google-beta_google_workstations_workstation_config` Terraform `resource`
block into the root module document.

Additionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the
resource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:

    # arguments omitted for brevity
    google-beta.google_workstations_workstation_config.new('some_id')

You can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `google-beta.google_workstations_workstation_config` using the reference:

    $._ref.google-beta_google_workstations_workstation_config.some_id.get('id')

This is the same as directly entering `"${ google-beta_google_workstations_workstation_config.some_id.id }"` as the value.

NOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,
or `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.
  - `annotations` (`obj`): Client-specified annotations. This is distinct from labels.

**Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the annotations present in your configuration.
Please refer to the field &#39;effective_annotations&#39; for all of the annotations present on the resource. When `null`, the `annotations` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `disable_tcp_connections` (`bool`): Disables support for plain TCP connections in the workstation. By default the service supports TCP connections via a websocket relay. Setting this option to true disables that relay, which prevents the usage of services that require plain tcp connections, such as ssh. When enabled, all communication must occur over https or wss. When `null`, the `disable_tcp_connections` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `display_name` (`string`): Human-readable name for this resource. When `null`, the `display_name` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `enable_audit_agent` (`bool`): Whether to enable Linux &#39;auditd&#39; logging on the workstation. When enabled, a service account must also be specified that has &#39;logging.buckets.write&#39; permission on the project. Operating system audit logging is distinct from Cloud Audit Logs. When `null`, the `enable_audit_agent` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `idle_timeout` (`string`): How long to wait before automatically stopping an instance that hasn&#39;t recently received any user traffic. A value of 0 indicates that this instance should never time out from idleness. Defaults to 20 minutes.
A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with &#39;s&#39;. Example: &#34;3.5s&#34;. When `null`, the `idle_timeout` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `labels` (`obj`): Client-specified labels that are applied to the resource and that are also propagated to the underlying Compute Engine resources.

**Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
Please refer to the field &#39;effective_labels&#39; for all of the labels present on the resource. When `null`, the `labels` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `location` (`string`): The location where the workstation cluster config should reside.
  - `project` (`string`): Set the `project` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `project` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `replica_zones` (`list`): Specifies the zones used to replicate the VM and disk resources within the region. If set, exactly two zones within the workstation cluster&#39;s region must be specifiedâ€”for example, &#39;[&#39;us-central1-a&#39;, &#39;us-central1-f&#39;]&#39;.
If this field is empty, two default zones within the region are used. Immutable after the workstation configuration is created. When `null`, the `replica_zones` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `running_timeout` (`string`): How long to wait before automatically stopping a workstation after it was started. A value of 0 indicates that workstations using this configuration should never time out from running duration. Must be greater than 0 and less than 24 hours if &#39;encryption_key&#39; is set. Defaults to 12 hours.
A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with &#39;s&#39;. Example: &#34;3.5s&#34;. When `null`, the `running_timeout` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `workstation_cluster_id` (`string`): The ID of the parent workstation cluster.
  - `workstation_config_id` (`string`): The ID to be assigned to the workstation cluster config.
  - `container` (`list[obj]`): Container that will be run for each workstation using this configuration when that workstation is started. When `null`, the `container` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google-beta.google_workstations_workstation_config.container.new](#fn-containernew) constructor.
  - `encryption_key` (`list[obj]`): Encrypts resources of this workstation configuration using a customer-managed encryption key.

If specified, the boot disk of the Compute Engine instance and the persistent disk are encrypted using this encryption key. If this field is not set, the disks are encrypted using a generated key. Customer-managed encryption keys do not protect disk metadata.
If the customer-managed encryption key is rotated, when the workstation instance is stopped, the system attempts to recreate the persistent disk with the new version of the key. Be sure to keep older versions of the key until the persistent disk is recreated. Otherwise, data on the persistent disk will be lost.
If the encryption key is revoked, the workstation session will automatically be stopped within 7 hours. When `null`, the `encryption_key` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google-beta.google_workstations_workstation_config.encryption_key.new](#fn-encryption_keynew) constructor.
  - `host` (`list[obj]`): Runtime host for a workstation. When `null`, the `host` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google-beta.google_workstations_workstation_config.host.new](#fn-hostnew) constructor.
  - `persistent_directories` (`list[obj]`): Directories to persist across workstation sessions. When `null`, the `persistent_directories` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google-beta.google_workstations_workstation_config.persistent_directories.new](#fn-persistent_directoriesnew) constructor.
  - `readiness_checks` (`list[obj]`): Readiness checks to be performed on a workstation. When `null`, the `readiness_checks` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google-beta.google_workstations_workstation_config.readiness_checks.new](#fn-readiness_checksnew) constructor.
  - `timeouts` (`obj`): Set the `timeouts` field on the resulting resource block. When `null`, the `timeouts` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google-beta.google_workstations_workstation_config.timeouts.new](#fn-timeoutsnew) constructor.

**Returns**:
- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn newAttrs

```ts
newAttrs()
```


`google-beta.google_workstations_workstation_config.newAttrs` constructs a new object with attributes and blocks configured for the `google_workstations_workstation_config`
Terraform resource.

Unlike [google-beta.google_workstations_workstation_config.new](#fn-new), this function will not inject the `resource`
block into the root Terraform document. Instead, this must be passed in as the `attrs` argument for the
[tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) function to build a complete block.

This is most useful when you need to preprocess the attributes with functions, conditional, or looping logic prior to
injecting into a complete block.

**Args**:
  - `annotations` (`obj`): Client-specified annotations. This is distinct from labels.

**Note**: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the annotations present in your configuration.
Please refer to the field &#39;effective_annotations&#39; for all of the annotations present on the resource. When `null`, the `annotations` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `disable_tcp_connections` (`bool`): Disables support for plain TCP connections in the workstation. By default the service supports TCP connections via a websocket relay. Setting this option to true disables that relay, which prevents the usage of services that require plain tcp connections, such as ssh. When enabled, all communication must occur over https or wss. When `null`, the `disable_tcp_connections` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `display_name` (`string`): Human-readable name for this resource. When `null`, the `display_name` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `enable_audit_agent` (`bool`): Whether to enable Linux &#39;auditd&#39; logging on the workstation. When enabled, a service account must also be specified that has &#39;logging.buckets.write&#39; permission on the project. Operating system audit logging is distinct from Cloud Audit Logs. When `null`, the `enable_audit_agent` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `idle_timeout` (`string`): How long to wait before automatically stopping an instance that hasn&#39;t recently received any user traffic. A value of 0 indicates that this instance should never time out from idleness. Defaults to 20 minutes.
A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with &#39;s&#39;. Example: &#34;3.5s&#34;. When `null`, the `idle_timeout` field will be omitted from the resulting object.

If this field is empty, two default zones within the region are used. Immutable after the workstation configuration is created. When `null`, the `replica_zones` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `running_timeout` (`string`): How long to wait before automatically stopping a workstation after it was started. A value of 0 indicates that workstations using this configuration should never time out from running duration. Must be greater than 0 and less than 24 hours if &#39;encryption_key&#39; is set. Defaults to 12 hours.
A duration in seconds with up to nine fractional digits, ending with &#39;s&#39;. Example: &#34;3.5s&#34;. When `null`, the `running_timeout` field will be omitted from the resulting object.

Be sure to keep older versions of the key until the persistent disk is recreated. Otherwise, data on the persistent disk will be lost.
If the encryption key is revoked, the workstation session will automatically be stopped within 7 hours. When `null`, the `encryption_key` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object. When setting the sub block, it is recommended to construct the object using the [google-beta.google_workstations_workstation_config.encryption_key.new](#fn-encryption_keynew) constructor.
  - `host` (`list[obj]`): Runtime host for a workstation. When `null`, the `host` sub block will be omitted from the resulting object.
